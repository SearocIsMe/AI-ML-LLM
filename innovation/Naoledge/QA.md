## Q10- What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?

Don’t think that this is a trick question! Many machine learning interview questions will be an attempt to lob basic questions at you just to make sure you’re on top of your game and you’ve prepared all of your bases.

Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. Briefly stated, Type I error means claiming something has happened when it hasn’t, while Type II error means that you claim nothing is happening when in fact something is.

A clever way to think about this is to think of 

* _Type I error as telling a man he is pregnant_
* _while Type II error means you tell a pregnant woman she isn’t carrying a baby_

# Q13- What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms?

More reading: Deep learning (Wikipedia)

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: 
how to use backpropagation and certain principles from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled or semi-structured data. 
In that sense, deep learning represents an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data through the use of neural nets.
